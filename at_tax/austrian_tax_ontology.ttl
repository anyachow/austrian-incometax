- Automatic classification of taxpayers based on income, residency, and business activity
- Implementation of Austrian tax thresholds and filing requirements (2025 updates)
- Support for complex scenarios including multiple income sources and cross-border taxation
- Reasoning capabilities for tax planning and compliance assessment

Double Taxation Treaties, EU Tax Directives

2025 Updated Criteria:
- Annual income below €13,308 (non-wage) or below combined thresholds
- No self-employment income

- Apply for Family Bonus Plus and other tax credits
- Utilize previous year loss carryovers

No penalty for not filing, but potential refunds are forfeit if not claimed within 5 years."""@en ;
