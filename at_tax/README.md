# Austrian Tax Return Filing Ontology

A semantic ontology using OWL 2 reasoning to determine Austrian tax filing obligations for individuals and organizations based on Austrian income tax law.

## Overview

This system uses an OWL 2 ontology combined with a Python reasoning engine to automatically determine whether a person or entity must file Austrian income tax returns. It leverages semantic web technologies and automated reasoning to provide accurate, rule-based decisions for both L1 (employee assessment) and E1 (supplementary assessment) tax returns.

## Architecture

### Components

1. **OWL 2 Ontology** (`austrian_tax_ontology_resident_only.owl` / `.ttl`)
   - Defines tax concepts, entities, and filing rules
   - Uses OWL 2 constructs for automated inference
   - Captures Austrian tax law requirements for residents with only domestic employee income

2. **Python Reasoning Engine** (`tax_reasoning_engine.py`)
   - Loads and processes the ontology
   - Applies basic RDF inference with custom tax classification rules
   - Provides query interface and interactive system

3. **Test Suite** (`test_austrian_tax_rules.py`)
   - Comprehensive test cases covering all filing scenarios
   - Validates system accuracy across different tax situations

4. **Conversion Utilities** (`convert_ttl_to_owl.py`)
   - Converts Turtle format ontology to OWL/XML for better compatibility
   - Automated conversion as part of the test pipeline

### Key Concepts

#### Entity Types
- **Austrian Resident**: Tax residents subject to Austrian tax law

#### Filing Classifications

**L1 Filing (Employee Assessment)**
- **MandatoryL1Filer**: Required due to specific conditions
- **VoluntaryL1Filer**: Optional filing that may be beneficial

**E1 Filing (Supplementary Assessment)**
- **MandatoryE1Filer**: Required when other income exceeds â‚¬730

#### Income Types
- **Annual Wage Income**: Employment income subject to wage tax
- **Other Income**: Self-employment, rental, investment income, etc.

## Tax Filing Rules

The system implements these Austrian tax filing rules:

### Mandatory L1 Filing (Employee Assessment)
1. **High Income with Conditions**: Annual wage income > â‚¬14,517 AND one of:
   - Incorrect tax credits applied
   - Multiple employments
   - Incorrect commuter allowance
   - Incorrect Family Bonus Plus

### Additional Mandatory L1 Filing
2. **No Wage Tax**: Annual wage income â‰¥ â‚¬13,308 with no wage tax withheld
3. **Special Payment Situations**: Sick pay, service vouchers, etc.
4. **Discretionary Assessment**: Discretionary assessment included in salary

### Voluntary L1 Filing
5. **Single Employer**: Income > â‚¬14,517 with single employer and correct wage tax
6. **Beneficial Circumstances**: Income > â‚¬14,517 with:
   - Varying income levels without rollup
   - Employer change during year
   - Social insurance repayment eligibility
   - Unclaimed tax credits or deductions

### Mandatory E1 Filing (Supplementary Assessment)
7. **Other Income Threshold**: Other income (self-employment, rental, etc.) > â‚¬730

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository** and navigate to the project directory

2. **Install Python dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Required files**:
   - `austrian_tax_ontology_resident_only.owl` - The OWL ontology
   - `austrian_tax_ontology_resident_only.ttl` - Turtle format (optional)
   - `tax_reasoning_engine.py` - Main Python script
   - `test_austrian_tax_rules.py` - Test suite
   - `requirements.txt` - Dependencies

## Usage

### Quick Start

```bash
python3 tax_reasoning_engine.py
```

The system will:
1. Load the OWL ontology
2. Apply reasoning rules
3. Add example entities
4. Show filing requirements for examples
5. Start interactive mode

### Running Tests

Execute the comprehensive test suite:

```bash
# Using the test runner script
./run_tests.sh

# Or run directly
python3 test_austrian_tax_rules.py
```

The test suite includes 18 test cases covering all major filing scenarios.

### Interactive Commands

Once in interactive mode, use these commands:

- `add <entity_id>` - Add a new entity interactively
- `check <entity_id>` - Check filing requirements for an entity
- `list <status>` - List entities by status (must_file/optional/no_filing)
- `rules` - Show explanation of filing rules
- `entities` - List all entities in the system
- `help` - Show help message
- `quit` - Exit the system

### Example Session

```
> add person_005
Adding entity: person_005
Name: Klaus Fischer
Type (Person/Organization): Person
Annual income (EUR, or press Enter to skip): 35000
Austrian resident? (y/n/skip): y
Has self-employment income? (y/n): n
Has multiple income streams? (y/n): n

=== Filing Requirements for person_005 ===
ðŸ“‹ MUST FILE tax return

Reasons:
  â€¢ Entity classified as 'Mandatory Filing L1'

> check person_005
=== Filing Requirements for person_005 ===
ðŸ“‹ MUST FILE tax return

Classifications: MandatoryL1Filer
Filing Requirement: MandatoryFilingL1

> list must_file
Entities with status 'must_file': ['person_001', 'person_005']
```

## Technical Details

### Reasoning Implementation
The system uses basic RDF inference combined with custom tax classification logic:

```python
# Example: Mandatory L1 classification
if annual_wage > 14517.0:
    has_mandatory_condition = any([
        has_incorrect_tax_credits,
        has_multiple_employments,
        has_incorrect_commuter_allowance,
        has_incorrect_family_bonus
    ])
    if has_mandatory_condition:
        self.graph.add((entity_uri, RDF.type, TAX.MandatoryL1Filer))
```

### Entity Properties
Entities are represented with comprehensive properties:

**Income Properties:**
- `hasAnnualWageIncome`: Employment income subject to wage tax
- `hasOtherIncome`: Self-employment, rental, investment income, etc.

**L1 Mandatory Conditions:**
- `hasIncorrectTaxCredits`: Incorrect tax credits applied
- `hasMultipleEmployments`: Multiple employment relationships
- `hasIncorrectCommuterAllowance`: Incorrect commuter allowance
- `hasIncorrectFamilyBonus`: Incorrect Family Bonus Plus

**L1 Additional Mandatory Conditions:**
- `hasNoWageTax`: No wage tax withheld despite income threshold
- `hasSpecialPaymentSituations`: Special payment circumstances
- `hasDiscretionaryAssessment`: Discretionary assessment in salary

**L1 Voluntary Conditions:**

- `hasEmployerChange`: Employer change during tax year
- `hasSVRepaymentEligibility`: Social insurance repayment eligibility
- `hasUnclaimedTaxCredits`: Unclaimed tax credits available
- `hasUnclaimedDeductions`: Unclaimed special expenses/deductions

## Test Cases

The system includes comprehensive test coverage:

1. **Mandatory L1 Cases**: High income with various mandatory conditions
